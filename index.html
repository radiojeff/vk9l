<h2>Lord Howe Island / July 2024</h2>

<i>Editor Note: I want to thank and point out the helpful comments
received on this matter.  In the ARRL DXCC Database, Lord Howe Island is listed with the
<b>Prefix VK9L</b>. <a target="top"
href="https://www.arrl.org/files/file/DXCC/2022_Current_Deleted.txt">ARRL DXCC List</a>
<p>
I'll still refer to LHI as <i>``VK9L''</i> out of habit, but realize it is the 
<b>DXCC entity</b> prefix, <b>not the call-sign prefix</b> associated with new 
operations on LHI.  Yes, this is confusing.  There'll be an update posted about this
within a couple weeks.  For reference,  
<a  target="top"
href="https://www.acma.gov.au/sites/default/files/2024-05/Amateur%20radio%20call%20sign%20policy_April%202024.pdf">ACMA Regulations</a></i>
<p>

<ul>
<li><b>CALL SIGN:  VK2/W7BRS (TBD pending decision)</b>  
<li><b>WHEN:</b> QRV July 20th -- August 1st, 2024
<li><b>WHERE:</b> Lord Howe Island
<li><b>WHAT:</b> <b><u>Holiday Style DX'p</u></b> DX on 40m through 10m.  Other bands as conditions permit.
<li><b>MODES:</b> CW, SSB and FT-8
<li><b>CONTEST:</b> Will participate in RSGB IOTA CW Contest July 27-28.
<li><b>TEAM:</b> <a target="top" href="https://www.qrz.com/db/W7BRS"><b>W7BRS</b></a>, ...
</ul>

<h2>Updates</h2>

<b>18-MAY-2024:</b> Due to a confusion about the callsign, the callsign is not yet
determined.  
The <a 
href="https://www.acma.gov.au/sites/default/files/2024-05/Amateur%20radio%20call%20sign%20policy_April%202024.pdf">regulations</a>
 put from the ACMA (Ausralia Communications &amp; Media 
Agency) are re-organizing the way in which remote islands/territories are assigned calls.
<p>
Lord Howe Island is (based on what I've been reading) is going to be a <b>VK2</b> call.
Visitors to Australia, regardless of where they operate, have to prefix their call with
<b>VK/</b> -- which makes it far more confusing -- are they are on the mainland, or an 
island or ....  
<p>
More details about the call sign will be updated here.  This effectively creates a new
set of issues that deal with the granting of LoTW Certificates since the TQSL application
does not allow a new certificate for LHI unless the prefix is VK9L.  That will have to be 
addressed by the LoTW desk when I re-apply for the certificate.
<p>
Likewise, Organizations like QRZ and ClubLog might need to make adjustments to the setup
for DX'peditions from visitors to Australia since VK9L is not a prefix to be used for LHI.
Yet trying to use <b>VK2/</b> fails to work for a DX'pedition on ClubLog.  QRZ has a similar
issue but not as distinct.

<h2>Where is Lord Howe Island?</h2>
Lord Howe Island is located approximately 700 km north-east of Sydney.
It home to the worlds most southern coral reef.   By account, the
island is home to several hundred species of fish, dozens types of coral,
and over a hundred species of birds.

<h2>The French</h2>

The interesting facts about how Lord Howe was discovered:
<p>

<blockquote style="width:480px">It was discovered by Lieut. Henry Ball, then in command
of his Majesty's ship <i>Supply</i>, on the 17th of February, 1788,
while on a voyage to Norfolk Island from Port Jackson (New South
Wales). He named the island after the hero of the ``glorious 1st of June,''
the Right Hon. Lord Howe. -- ``A Visit to Lord Howe Island,'' by
Alfred T. Corrie, Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society
of London, Vol 22, No 2 (1877-1878), pp 136-143.</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote style="width:480px">
En route, almost mid-point
between Sydney and Norfolk Island, Lt. Ball discovered and named Lord Howe Island
on 17 February, 61 returning on 13 March 1788 to claim possession to prevent
French occupation. The two ships of the La Perouse expedition had landed at
Botany Bay only two days after the First Fleet and the British officers would have
been worried that after leaving the NSW mainland, La Perouse might happen upon
Lord Howe Island and claim it for France. --

<div id="goals" style="display:none;">

<h1>Goals</h1>
<ol>
<li> To provide a fully imersive experience with DX'pedition
     planning, deployment and execution for a semi-rare entity
     in the Pacific (Oceania) region.</li>
<li> To experience the adventure of being on site relying on
     sound engineering judgement to setup and operate all
     common modes on as many HF bands as antenna permit (CW, SSB, FT-8)
     on 40 meters through 10 meters.</li>
<li> To lay a foundation for not only the Organizer to participate
     with future DX'peditions but also encourage and inspire those
     like the author who have dreamed for years to undertake the
     challenge of going on an adventure.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Note to Amateur Radio DX'ers</h2>

<ul>
   <li> Expect the CW to be a little slower -- 24-27 w.p.m is the goal.</li>
   <li> Expect hours of operation to be based on limits imposed
        by weather, rest and band conditions.</li>
   <li> Bonus: Will overlap on the RSGB IOTA contest (intentional)
       Contest running as OC-004 in RSGB IOTA for JULY 27 through JULY 28th,
       2024:

From: Jeff Wandling, W7BRS
<br>
To Whom it may concern:<br><p>

DX'peditions are the passion of many amateur radio operators.  Many
chase after them and a few actually go to activate an interesting
location.

<p>
Many pleasant parts of amateur radio are involved with chasing for 
good DX contacts, like Lord Howe Island.
<p>

I am an amateur radio operator who loves to work DX. Now I have a
chance to (figuratively) put my ``feet in the sand''.  As an active
member of the Western Washington DX Club, I have been involved only
from the outside looking at what is involved in a DX'pedition.  Now,
I am going to take my passion for DX to the South Pacific and work
from Lord Howe Island.
<p>

The <b>inspiration to do this</b> is from two sources:
<p>

<ol>
<li> After dreaming about doing a DX'pedition for about 14 years, I
    finally decided that unless action was taken to plan and go
    then it would never happen.  The goal in the scoping document is to
    lay the ground work for future experiences with DX'peditions.
    I had to start somewhere -- so why not go ``full throttle'' to a
    very exciting location.

<li> Inspiration from friends in the DX community.
    Each of them, in their own way contributed to nudging me ever closer
    to this point.
</ol>
<p>

Your consideration and support is welcome.  I assure you my effort to
implement this DX'pedition will leverage your support in the best
way possible.
<p>

If you feel so inclined, any support you wish to offer will be greatly
appreciated and recognized through this web site, QRZ and the QSL cards.
<p>

At the very least, I look forward to hearing your signal and 
working your station this July from Lord Howe Island.
<p>

Sincerely,
<p>
